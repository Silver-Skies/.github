### Purpose
The goal currently is to recreate all of technology again with modern knowledge. For example, processors back then came with incremental changes and old features were kept but no longer used. The processors have become messy, unreliable, and expensive now. Instead we plan to manufacture, design and release our own processor with a much higher efficiency and stability with better quality and care for design.

### Current project
Right now the processor emulator and architecture interpreter is being developed.
